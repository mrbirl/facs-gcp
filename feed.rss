				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Email marketers spend a lot of time crafting email campaigns. From testing various email copy to crafting enticing subject lines in an attempt to maximize open rates and click through rates. But if your emails end up in peoples spam box instead of their inbox, your emails simply won&#8217;t get read.</p>
<p>A recent IBM study highlighted the impact deliverability rates can have on your email marketing. Their study found that 17% of emails never see the inside of the recipients inbox.</p>
<p>The only way to avoid spam filters is to understand how spam filters work and how you can avoid them. In this post we&#8217;ll go through the effects bad deliverability can have on your campaigns, the different spam filters and how they work, and how to craft emails that will avoid spam filters.</p>
<h3>Effect of bad deliverability</h3>
<p>In 2012 Sony launched an email marketing campaign to cross-sell the PlayStation Vita to existing PlayStation customers. The campaign was sent to 4.2 million people and resulted in 9,236 devices being sold, generating <a href="https://econsultancy.com/blog/65329-seven-inspirational-email-marketing-case-studies-from-the-digitals/" target="_blank">€2.9 million in revenue</a>.</p>
<p>Lets say for arguments sake that 17% of the emails sony sent out ended up in spam boxes. That&#8217;s 714,000 emails. Had all those emails been delivered, sony could have potentially sold an extra 1919 units, generating an extra €602,537 in revenue. That being said, you&#8217;re not going to have 100% deliverability. But there are tricks you can use to maximize your email deliverability rate.</p>
<h3>How spam filters work</h3>
<p class="p1">To maximize deliverability rates for your campaigns it is really important to have a basic knowledge of how spam filters actually work and on what basis they flag an email as spam.</p>
<p class="p1">Spam filters generally use a scoring framework and look at a few things when deciding what to do with emails: the sender&#8217;s technical specifics, the email&#8217;s content, reputation, and engagement.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><em>Technical Specifics</em></strong></p>
<p class="p1">Spam filters will typically check for appropriate email authentication and your sending IP&#8217;s reputation when deciding whether to deliver your emails or make them disappear into cyberspace.</p>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>Content</strong></em></p>
<p class="p1">Here we&#8217;re talking about the actual content that is in your subject line and body of the email. Spam filters work by scanning the entire copy of the email searching for specific words typically found in spammy emails. In addition to the copy of the email the filters will look at formatting, link types, and image-to-text ratio. Some services like gmail will also look at spammy text within an image using image recognition.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><em>User Defined</em></strong></p>
<p class="p1">This is also know as bayesian filtering and it&#8217;s one of the most widely used type of spam filters. These filters work by watching recipients classifying emails as junk. When a user classifies an email as spam the filter looks at the words and phrases in the subject line, email content, links, and so on. Over time, the filter learns to scan for those traits in every email.</p>
<h3>Tactics for avoiding spam filters</h3>
<p>Now you know how spam filters work, her&#8217;s how you can avoid them and maximize your email deliverability rate.</p>
<p><em><strong>Avoid spam words</strong></em></p>
<p>One of the fastest ways to end up in a subscriber&#8217;s spam folder is to load your email up with words that most email service providers have identified as common words in spam email. A good rule of thumb is, if it sounds like salesman lingo then it&#8217;s probably a spam trigger word.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there isn&#8217;t one simple list of a all the words you should avoid. This is because spam filters are so sophisticated and words will vary between industries.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s some examples of spam words to avoid if you are in the financial or marketing space:</p>
<p><em>Financial</em></p>
<div class="su-table">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>$$$</td>
<td>Affordable</td>
<td>Bargin</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cash</td>
<td>Cash bonus</td>
<td>Cheap</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>F r e e</td>
<td>Fast cash</td>
<td>For just $XXX</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Get out of debt</td>
<td>No fees</td>
<td>Save big money</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Save up to</td>
<td>Stock alert</td>
<td>Subject to credit</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Unsecured debt</td>
<td>US dollars</td>
<td>Why pay more</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p><em>Marketing</em></p>
<div class="su-table">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Click here</td>
<td>Email marketing</td>
<td>Form</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Increase sales</td>
<td>Increase traffic</td>
<td>More internet traffic</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Internet marketing</td>
<td>Marketing solutions</td>
<td>Month trial offer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Online marketing</td>
<td>Visit our site</td>
<td>Web traffic</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><em><strong>Formatting</strong></em></p>
<p>Suspicious formatting not only triggers spam filters, it might also annoy your recipients into marking your emails as a spam. Here are some basic formatting tips when designing your emails:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>AVOID CAPITAL LETTERS</strong> &#8211; avoid using capital letters in your email copy and subject lines.</li>
<li><b>Don&#8217;t over-use punctuation marks!!!!!?</b> &#8211; try and avoid excessive use of punctuation marks, especially in a row.F</li>
<li><strong>Keep fonts consistent</strong> &#8211; avoid bright <span style="color: red;">red</span> fonts or going crazy with <strong><span style="color: blue;">c</span><span style="color: green;">o</span><span style="color: yellow;">l</span><span style="color: pink;">o</span><span style="color: grey;">r</span><span style="color: purple;">s</span></strong>, styles, and formatting.</li>
<li><strong>Provide an unsubscribe link</strong> &#8211; This is the law. If your emails are missing an unsubscribe link they&#8217;ll trigger spam filters.</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t link too much</strong> &#8211; try and include as few links as possible in your emails. For any links you do include, avoid using URL shorteners as they&#8217;re frequently abused by spammers.</li>
<li><strong>Make sure the HTML code is clean</strong> &#8211; sloppy HTML code can get you spam filtered. If you use a drag and drop editor to code your email sometimes they include useless code that&#8217;s invisible to the user. This makes filters think you&#8217;re a sloppy spammer.</li>
<li><strong>Include text</strong> &#8211; Sometimes it can be appealing to just use a bunch of slick graphics and images. But spam filters can&#8217;t read images so they assume you&#8217;re a spammer trying to trick them.</li>
<li><b>Avoid mashing text with numbers</b> &#8211; creative spelling is a classic sign of a spammer trying to include words they shouldn&#8217;t. For instance: Cl1ck h3r3 f0r fr33 cash.</li>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>Engagement</strong></em></p>
<p>Subscriber engagement is a huge part of getting emails into people&#8217;s inboxes. If your subscribers consistently ignore your emails, failing to open and click your emails, mail servers are going to presume you&#8217;re a spam sender. If your emails are getting low engagement they will end up in spam boxes, even if your subscribers aren&#8217;t marking the email as spam.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s some basic things you can do to avoid being flagged as spam if your emails have low engagement rates:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Have a policy for unengaged recipients</strong> &#8211; if someone is constantly ignoring your emails, remove them from your list. Keeping them on your list will do more harm than good.</li>
<li><b>Keep email frequency low</b> &#8211; if you&#8217;re bombarding your subscribers with emails over a short period of time you&#8217;re increasing the likelihood they will be unengaged.</li>
<li><strong>Keep your email list current and clean</strong> &#8211; if you start sending campaigns to old lists and prospects then you&#8217;re running the risk of the recipients marking your email as spam as they&#8217;ve probably forgotten who you are.</li>
<li><strong>Remove bounces</strong> &#8211; if an email bounces, remove that recipient from your list.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Takeaways</h3>
<p>Email marketing continues to be one of the most effective channels. But if your emails aren&#8217;t ending up in people&#8217;s inboxes then your emails aren&#8217;t going to get read and you&#8217;ll miss out on all that potential revenue.</p>
<p>Now you have a basic understanding of how spam filters work and how you can avoid them you should keep these tips in mind when crafting your next campaign.</p>

<p><strong>9.</strong> Mobile matters: as of 2015, 53% of emails are opened on mobile. (<a href="https://litmus.com/blog/53-of-emails-opened-on-mobile-outlook-opens-decrease-33" target="_blank">Litmus</a>)</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> Even though half of all emails are opened on mobile, only 42% of marketers are optimizing for mobile. (<a href="http://www.marketingsherpa.com/article/excerpt/free-excerpt-email-marketing-benchmark-2013" target="_blank">MarketingSherpa</a>)</p>
<p><strong>11.</strong> 80% of consumers will immediately delete if they don&#8217;t display properly. (<a href="http://www.bizreport.com/2013/03/bluehornet-302-unsubscribe-on-receipt-of-a-badly-formatted-m.html" target="_blank">BlueHornet</a>)</p>

<h3>Email Effectiveness Statistics</h3>
<p>Still unsure if email is an effective channel for marketing? The statistics below speak for themselves.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1131 size-full" src="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-segmentation-case-studies-ROI-data.jpg" alt="email segmentation case studies ROI data" width="800" height="368" srcset="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-segmentation-case-studies-ROI-data-610x281.jpg 610w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-segmentation-case-studies-ROI-data-326x150.jpg 326w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-segmentation-case-studies-ROI-data-400x184.jpg 400w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-segmentation-case-studies-ROI-data-300x138.jpg 300w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-segmentation-case-studies-ROI-data.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>New findings ROI has increased to $43 for every $1 invested.</i></p>
<p><strong>13.</strong> Email converts better than SEO, digital ads, and social media. For every $1 invested in email marketing the average return is $43. That&#8217;s an ROI of 4300%. (<a href="https://litmus.com/blog/53-of-emails-opened-on-mobile-outlook-opens-decrease-33" target="_blank">Litmus</a>)</p>
<p><strong>14.</strong> The average open rate (across all sectors &amp; company sizes) is 22.14% and the average click-through-rate (CTR) is 2.79%. (<a href="http://mailchimp.com/resources/research/email-marketing-benchmarks/" target="_blank">MailChimp</a>)</p>
<p><strong>15.</strong> Marketers find that 2X higher open rates occur on mobile versus desktop. (<a href="http://marketingland.com/77-percent-of-us-want-to-get-marketing-messages-via-email-theres-no-close-second-place-study-says-9420" target="_blank">MarketingLand</a>)</p>
<p><strong>16.</strong> Emails that include social sharing buttons have a higher CTR of 158% than those that don&#8217;t include share links. (<a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/social-sharing-boosts-email-ctr.html" target="_blank">GetResponse</a>)</p>
<p><strong>17.</strong> Segmentation is critical. Four out of ten email subscribers mark emails as spam because they find the email irrelevant. (<a href="http://www.marketingsherpa.com/heap/WisdomReport2011.pdf" target="_blank">MarketingSherpa</a>)</p>
<p><strong>18.</strong> Deliverability is a big issue: 17% of all emails never see the inside of a recipient’s inbox. This is due to defunct emails and SPAM traps. (<a href="http://www.ibm.com" target="_blank">IBM</a>)</p>
<p><strong>19.</strong> Only 17% of marketers track and analyze their email marketing efforts, yet 60% of marketers believe email marketing produces positive ROI. (<a href="https://www.marketingsherpa.com/data/public/reports/benchmark-reports/EXCERPT-BMR-2013-Email-Marketing.pdf" target="_blank">MarkertingSherpa</a>)</p>
<p><strong>20.</strong> You are 6X more likely to get a click through from an email campaign than you are from a tweet. Maybe it&#8217;s time to start taking email marketing a bit more seriously. (<a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/email-marketing/2014/07/email-marketing-vs-social-media/" target="_blank">CampaingMonitor</a>)</p>
<h3>Takeaways</h3>
<p>Email clearly still matters and it doesn&#8217;t look like it&#8217;s going anywhere anytime soon. However from looking at these email marketing statistics it is quite clear that a lot of marketers have really bad habits.</p>
<p>It is evident that mobile is being completely neglected. This is one of the biggest reasons email marketing under performs. Also deliverability remains to be a massive issue, with nearly 20% of emails getting lost in transit.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In terms of users,  email out numbers any social network. By the end of 2016 there will be over 4.3 billion email accounts. In addition to this, email marketing is still ranked as the best channel in terms of return on investment.</p>
<p>But is your email marketing performing as well as it could? A report published by <a href="https://www.marketingsherpa.com/data/public/reports/benchmark-reports/EXCERPT-BMR-2013-Email-Marketing.pdf" target="_blank">Marketing Sherpa</a> found that 83% of marketers surveyed are overlooking the importance of tracking and testing their email marketing and metrics.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1192" src="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-stats.jpg" alt="Stats for marketers that are using email marketing optimization tactics" width="300" height="304" srcset="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-stats-148x150.jpg 148w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-stats-400x405.jpg 400w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-stats-300x304.jpg 300w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-stats.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>In this post I&#8217;ll give you 10 actionable email marketing optimization tactics you can use to keep your subscribers subscribed and interested in your emails.</p>
<h3>1. Optimize for mobile</h3>
<p>Smartphones and tablets can no longer be ignored by email marketers. <a href="https://litmus.com/blog/53-of-emails-opened-on-mobile-outlook-opens-decrease-33" target="_blank">A report</a> published last year found that 53% of emails are opened on mobile. And that figure will continue to grow rapidly over the coming years.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1184" src="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-mobile-optimized.jpg" alt="A mobile optimized email example" width="352" height="662" srcset="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-mobile-optimized-300x564.jpg 300w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-mobile-optimized.jpg 352w" sizes="(max-width: 352px) 100vw, 352px" /></p>
<p>If that statistic doesn&#8217;t give food for thought, this will. <a href="http://www.bizreport.com/2013/03/bluehornet-302-unsubscribe-on-receipt-of-a-badly-formatted-m.html" target="_blank">A report </a>from email marketing company BlueHornet found that over 80% of consumers immediately delete emails that don&#8217;t display properly on  a mobile device.</p>
<p><em><strong>Takeaway: </strong></em>If you&#8217;re not optimizing for mobile you have an 80% chance that message will be instantly deleted and run the risk of losing that subscriber altogether.</p>
<h3>2. Match your subject line to your email copy</h3>
<p>Most of your subscribers are probably being bombarded with spammy emails on a daily basis. The last thing they want to do is open an email with a compelling subject line only to find the body of the email has nothing to do with the subject.</p>
<p>Your subject line offers a snippet of the email. If it is misleading you are likely to frustrate your readers and deter them from opening future emails.</p>
<p>Businesses who use misleading subject lines may see a lift in open rates, but will more than likely experience decreased click-through rates as the content doesn&#8217;t match the promise of the subject.</p>
<p><strong><em>Takeaway: </em></strong>Your subject line offers a promise of the email. To make sure the align you should write the subject line after you&#8217;ve written the content.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>3. Optimize landing pages to match email copy</h3>
<p>To create a seamless online experience for your customers you need to create specific landing pages for specific email marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>Does the landing page fulfill the expectations of the value proposition of the link leading into it? If the answer is no, then the reader will likely be confused and you&#8217;ll decrease the chances of converting that sale.</p>
<p>ASOS do an awesome job of this. I get this email:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1185" src="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-asos-email.jpg" alt="Example email from ASOS" width="800" height="500" srcset="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-asos-email-610x381.jpg 610w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-asos-email-240x150.jpg 240w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-asos-email-400x250.jpg 400w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-asos-email-300x188.jpg 300w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-asos-email.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>And here&#8217;s the corresponding landing page to that CTA:</p>
<p><a href="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-asos-offer-landing-page.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1187" src="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-asos-offer-landing-page.jpg" alt="ASOS landing page that corresponds to email" width="800" height="656" srcset="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-asos-offer-landing-page-610x500.jpg 610w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-asos-offer-landing-page-183x150.jpg 183w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-asos-offer-landing-page-400x328.jpg 400w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-asos-offer-landing-page-300x246.jpg 300w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-asos-offer-landing-page.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p>I love the way that the CTA is tied to the landing page. All I have to do is pick the size and checkout. Two simple steps.</p>
<p>The email is essentially a template for your website. If I get a promotional email for &#8220;50% off shoes&#8221; and the email directs me to a page with jumpers, the likelihood is I&#8217;ll just close the tab.</p>
<p><em><strong>Takeaway: </strong></em>Increase your sales conversions by matching your email campaigns with your landing pages.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>4. Include social sharing</h3>
<p><a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/social-sharing-boosts-email-ctr.html" target="_blank">GetResponse </a>report that emails including social sharing buttons have a 158% higher click-through rate than those that don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>By including social sharing buttons in your emails you create a simple way for your subscribers to share with their social following. This in turn could generate new leads for your business.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1188 size-full" src="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-social-share.jpg" alt="Email from groove that includes a social share button" width="800" height="448" srcset="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-social-share-610x342.jpg 610w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-social-share-268x150.jpg 268w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-social-share-400x224.jpg 400w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-social-share-300x168.jpg 300w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-social-share.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Takeaway: </em></strong>Include social share buttons in your emails you&#8217;ll extend your email reach.</p>
<h3>5. Optimize your emails with images turned off</h3>
<p>This is a really simple but effective tip that will improve click-through rates from your emails. A lot of email providers, like Outlook &amp; Yahoo, have images turned off by default which can have a disastrous effect on your email campaigns.</p>
<p>Obviously using images in your email campaigns allows you to create much nicer and compelling emails, so I&#8217;m not saying you shouldn&#8217;t use images. Just get smart about the design/layout. At the very least you should be placing useful and descriptive alt tags on all your images, as this text will display instead if the images don&#8217;t display.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1189" src="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-non-image-optimized.jpg" alt="example email optimized for when images don't display" width="800" height="552" srcset="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-non-image-optimized-610x421.jpg 610w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-non-image-optimized-217x150.jpg 217w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-non-image-optimized-400x276.jpg 400w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-non-image-optimized-300x207.jpg 300w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-non-image-optimized.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>When image appears vs when they don&#8217;t</em></p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://litmus.com/blog/pizzaexpress-inspires-with-images-off-email-optimization" target="_blank">this example</a> of how PizzaExpress optimize their emails in the event that the images don&#8217;t show.</p>
<p><em><strong>Takeaway: </strong></em>Make sure to include descriptive alt tags for your images so the reader can understand the email if the images don&#8217;t display.</p>
<h3>6. Segment your subscribers</h3>
<p>Relevance is central to today’s marketing strategy, and buyers have come to expect personalization in their communications. Four out of ten subscribers will mark an email as spam simply because they were irrelevant.</p>
<p class="p1">Emails that have been tailored to specific audiences through segmentation get 39% more opens and 24% more revenue than non-segmented lists.</p>
<p class="p1">You can build your segmentation strategy based on your different customer personas. Once you&#8217;ve defined your different segments you can identify the data points you wish to use to divide your list and then begin crafting tailored content.</p>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>Takeaway: </strong></em>Tailor your campaigns to each segment and you&#8217;ll increase click-through rates and profits.</p>
<h3>7. Create a clear CTA</h3>
<p>One of the best ways to increase conversion rates is to optimize your call-to-action buttons. The purpose of your CTA is to leave no room for doubt</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1190" src="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-clear-cta.jpg" alt="Example of an email with one clear CTA" width="800" height="618" srcset="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-clear-cta-610x471.jpg 610w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-clear-cta-194x150.jpg 194w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-clear-cta-400x309.jpg 400w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-clear-cta-300x232.jpg 300w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-clear-cta.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Good example of an email with a clear CTA</em></p>
<p>The best performing emails will contain one clear CTA.</p>
<p>Your call to action should be obvious and visually appealing, leaving no room for doubt about what the reader should do next.</p>
<p><em><strong>Takeaway: </strong></em>Include one clear and prominent CTA to increase your click-through rates.</p>
<h3>8. Use a newsletter service</h3>
<p>This probably seems like a weird point but it is really important that you use the right email marketing provider. When running email marketing campaigns a lot of businesses don&#8217;t think about the deliverability of their emails.</p>
<p>Some service providers have much better deliverability rates than others. <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2013/06/24/5-simple-ways-to-increase-your-email-deliverability-rates/" target="_blank">Quicksprout</a> found that switching provider resulted in a 44% increase in open rates and a 67% increase in click-through rates. The email copy and subject lines were the exact same on both services.</p>
<p><strong><em>Takeaway: </em></strong>Do research before picking an email marketing app.</p>
<h3>9. Personalize you emails</h3>
<p>Email is one of the most personal mediums we have to communicate with our customers at scale. Subscribers understand that email campaigns are sent out to the masses, but that doesn&#8217;t mean they will settle for generic email blasts.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1191" src="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-personalization-fail.jpg" alt="A email attempting to be personal but put the wrong tag where name should be" width="800" height="550" srcset="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-personalization-fail-610x419.jpg 610w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-personalization-fail-218x150.jpg 218w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-personalization-fail-400x275.jpg 400w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-personalization-fail-300x206.jpg 300w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Email-marketing-optimization-tactics-personalization-fail.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>When a subscriber signs up and uses your product try and get as much information as possible. This will allow you to include personalizations such as name, interests, location and so on.</p>
<p>Also writing in the second person is a lot more personable, so try and use language like &#8216;you&#8217; and &#8216;me&#8217;.</p>
<p><em><strong>Takeaway: </strong></em>Personalizing your emails will create a much better tone in your emails and will build better relationships with your subscribers.</p>
<h3>10. Make your emails as short as possible</h3>
<p>The shorter the email, the greater the chance someone will read and engage with them. Most people suffer from email overload. As a result they will give your email a quick scan and decide within a few seconds whether to delete it or click-through. Unnecessarily long emails introduce friction and decrease the chances the reader will interact with the email.</p>
<p>For newsletters in particular, you should just include a short teaser enticing the reader to click through to the full content on your website.</p>
<p><strong><em>Takeaway: </em></strong>To increase the chances of your readers clicking through shorten your emails and reduce the amount of text.</p>
<p>And there you have it. We&#8217;ve just gone through 10 email marketing optimization tactics you can start incorporating into your email marketing straight away and increase your ROI.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Email still matters. A lot! In some previous posts we went through the <a href="http://birdleaf.io/why-email-marketing-segmentation-matters">benefits of email marketing</a> and some real working <a href="http://birdleaf.io/5-killer-email-segmentation-case-studies">case studies of email marketing segmentation strategies</a> that have proven results.</p>
<p>Email marketing has some major advantages compared to most other marketing channels. It&#8217;s got high reach, it&#8217;s low cost and it&#8217;s easy to test once you&#8217;ve built a small email list.</p>
<p>In this post we’re going to cover the top three types of email marketing strategies, how to employ them successfully, and finally their advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<h3>1. Educational Emails</h3>
<p>Educational emails revolve around providing your subscribers with industry knowledge that&#8217;s connected to your business or product.</p>
<p>This involves creating a piece of content (e.g. infographic, white papers, blog articles) and giving your subscribers a snippet of the content in an email prompting them back to your website. Or if your message is concise you may just send an email.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1160" src="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/educational_email.jpg" alt="an educational email sent by help scout as part of their email marketing strategy" width="680" height="468" srcset="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/educational_email-610x420.jpg 610w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/educational_email-218x150.jpg 218w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/educational_email-400x275.jpg 400w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/educational_email-300x206.jpg 300w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/educational_email.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Educational content and email is really effective if your target audience is facing a problem or issue that your company can solve.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It builds trust</strong>. As you continually provide your subscribers with valuable information you will be seen as a industry thought leader. This increases they likely-hood they will evaluate your product when looking to purchase.</li>
<li><strong>It&#8217;s sharable</strong>. As you create and deliver more valuable information your subscribers will be more likely to spread it on social networks. The more your content get shared the more leads you&#8217;ll generate.</li>
<li><strong>It drives sales</strong>. If you consistently send the right information, at the right time, as your subscriber moves through the<a href="http://birdleaf.io/why-email-marketing-segmentation-matters" target="_blank"> sales cycle</a> you increase the likely-hood that they will purchase from you over a competitor.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It takes time</strong>. When you send an educational email, you’re trying to build a relationship with your customers. With that in mind it can take time to create relevant content and emails.</li>
</ol>
<h3>2. Promotional Emails</h3>
<p>Nothing entices a customer more than a great deal. Your customer saves a few bucks and your revenue gets a boost. Not bad, right?</p>
<p>Most e-commerce businesses rely heavily on promotional emails. But regardless of what kind of a business you run, you should know how to make offers in your emails.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1161" src="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/promotional_email.jpg" alt="A promotional email sent as part of an email marketing strategy" width="662" height="480" srcset="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/promotional_email-610x442.jpg 610w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/promotional_email-207x150.jpg 207w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/promotional_email-400x290.jpg 400w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/promotional_email-300x218.jpg 300w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/promotional_email.jpg 662w" sizes="(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px" /></p>
<p>Promotional emails aren’t reserved for only things like, “Get 70% off today only!” A promotional email can offer other perks too, like free shipping or a free product trial.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Easy to set up</strong>. Once you know what it is you’re promoting, all you need is the copy. Dedicated emails don’t have to rely on graphics or fancy layouts to engage readers.</li>
<li><strong>Easy to track</strong>. As promotional emails tend to have only one call-to-action it&#8217;s easy to see who clicked through and purchased.</li>
<li><strong>Quick impact on sales</strong>. If you&#8217;re not hitting your targets for the month you can run a quick promotion to boost sales.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Limited in what you can include</strong>. The whole point on promotional emails is having one very clear call-to-action. Your message will become quickly diluted if you start including multiple offers etc.</li>
<li><strong>Can be irrelevant to subscriber</strong>. Some people on your email marketing list won&#8217;t get any value from your promotion and may unsubscribe. This may happen if you carry a big product range and send a Male a &#8220;70% off womens jeans&#8221; promotion. To keep them relevant you need to segment your list.</li>
</ol>
<h3>3. Lead Nurturing Emails</h3>
<p>For many businesses, building a relationship with their leads is the primary reason for sending any emails. This is because you can specifically targeting subscribers that you want to turn into customers. This can be time consuming to set up but can yield massive returns.</p>
<p>People do business with businesses they know and trust. The first time someone converts on your website, the likelihood that they really know who you are or understand why they should do business with you is pretty slim. As you build relationships with your leads you are increasing the chances that they will purchase from you as they move through the sales cycle.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1162" src="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/lead_nurturing_email.jpg" alt="lead nurturing email example by hubspot as part of their email marketing strategy" width="800" height="590" srcset="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/lead_nurturing_email-610x450.jpg 610w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/lead_nurturing_email-203x150.jpg 203w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/lead_nurturing_email-400x295.jpg 400w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/lead_nurturing_email-300x221.jpg 300w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/lead_nurturing_email.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Example of an automated lead nurturing email by HubSpot</em></p>
<p>It is important to note that relationship building should be part of each email marketing strategy. No matter what kind of an email you send.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Can be very personable</strong>. You are connecting directly with the client and tailoring your email and pitch specifically to them. This in turn will increase brand awareness and build trust.</li>
<li><strong>Increase response</strong> <strong>rate</strong>. According to HubSpot, lead nurturing emails achieve <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/29757/Lead-Nurturing-Generates-Nearly-3X-More-Clicks-Than-Email-Blasts-Data.aspx">4-10 times the response rate</a> compared to standalone emails.</li>
<li><strong>Shorten sales cycle</strong>.  <a title="Market2Lead found" href="http://customerexperiencematrix.blogspot.com/2010/09/hard-data-to-justify-your-marketing.html" target="_self">Market2Lead found </a>that nurtured leads have a 23% shorter sales cycle.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Time consuming</strong>. The main disadvantage is probably the amount of time and effort you’ll need to put behind your lead nurturing campaigns. Chances are each client will need a slightly tweaked approach, meaning very little can be templated.</li>
<li><strong>They generate less buzz.</strong> More lead nurturing emails are only sent to one address, rather than the thousands-strong subscriber list of your newsletter.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Takeaways</h3>
<p>There we have it! Three of the top email marketing strategies you should be implementing if you&#8217;re taking email marketing seriously.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the most effective email marketing campaign is  a mix of all of these techniques. Typically you should use three different email marketing strategies. You can emphasize some more than others, but you shouldn’t just stubbornly stick to one strategy.</p>

<li>Nearly there! Under &#8216;Filter Mailchimp Triggers&#8217;, select the list in your Mailchimp account which you would like emails to be added from. In the picture below we&#8217;ve chosen our &#8216;Newsletter Subscribers&#8217; list, so any emails added to that list (when someone signs up to our newsletter) will be sent to Birdleaf.<a href="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-20-at-3.48.50-p.m..png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1153" src="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-20-at-3.48.50-p.m.-930x365.png" alt="Choose a MailChimp list" width="930" height="365" srcset="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-20-at-3.48.50-p.m.-610x239.png 610w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-20-at-3.48.50-p.m.-930x365.png 930w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-20-at-3.48.50-p.m.-383x150.png 383w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-20-at-3.48.50-p.m.-1400x549.png 1400w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-20-at-3.48.50-p.m.-400x157.png 400w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-20-at-3.48.50-p.m.-300x118.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 930px) 100vw, 930px" /></a>We also only want to send subscribers that we get an email for. This is likely to be pretty much every subscriber, but you can optionally add a &#8216;Custom Filter&#8217; to make sure only ones with emails are sent (see above picture).</li>
<li>Now we need to tell Birdleaf what to do with the info from MailChimp. Select the list in Birdleaf where you would like your MailChimp subscribers to be added. You also need to let Birdleaf know which MailChimp field is the email address, so we know what to look up! Under &#8216;Email&#8217; click &#8216;Insert Fields&#8217;, the select &#8216;Email&#8217;.<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1154" src="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-20-at-3.53.58-p.m.-930x270.png" alt="Match MailChimp to Birdleaf in Zapier" width="930" height="270" srcset="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-20-at-3.53.58-p.m.-610x177.png 610w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-20-at-3.53.58-p.m.-930x270.png 930w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-20-at-3.53.58-p.m.-516x150.png 516w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-20-at-3.53.58-p.m.-1400x407.png 1400w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-20-at-3.53.58-p.m.-400x116.png 400w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-20-at-3.53.58-p.m.-300x87.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 930px) 100vw, 930px" /></li>
<li>Before finishing you can optionally test your connection to make sure everything is working.</li>
<li>Finally, give your Zap a name and turn it on! <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1155" src="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-20-at-4.02.01-p.m.-930x199.png" alt="Name Your MailChimp To Birdleaf Zap" width="930" height="199" srcset="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-20-at-4.02.01-p.m.-610x131.png 610w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-20-at-4.02.01-p.m.-930x199.png 930w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-20-at-4.02.01-p.m.-701x150.png 701w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-20-at-4.02.01-p.m.-1400x300.png 1400w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-20-at-4.02.01-p.m.-400x86.png 400w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-20-at-4.02.01-p.m.-300x64.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 930px) 100vw, 930px" />Once it&#8217;s turned on, new subscribers to that MailChimp list will automatically be added to your Birdleaf account and researched!</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s common knowledge that <a href="http://birdleaf.io/why-email-marketing-segmentation-matters">segmenting your email-marketing lists</a> helps you get better open and click rates, which ultimately leads to increased revenue. By narrowing your focus and sending tailored messages to targeted groups within your lists, your recipients will find your campaigns more relevant—and relevant campaigns get better results.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/13879/Segment-Your-Email-List-To-Increase-Open-Rates-Data.aspx" target="_blank">eMarketer</a>, &#8220;39% of marketers who segmented their email lists experienced higher open rates, and 24% experienced greater revenue.&#8221;</p>
<p>If utilised correctly, email can convert better than any other channel. A report found that for every $1 you invest in email you&#8217;ll get a <a href="http://www.business2community.com/email-marketing/14-email-marketing-statistics-you-need-to-know-0513966#RT5mCrlEHA4EQHeJ.97" target="_blank">$40 return</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Email can represent a 4000% ROI</em></p>
<p>In this post we&#8217;ll go through five highly effective email segmentation case studies. Each case study is different. Some companies segment by behavioural data whilst others  segment by demographical data.</p>
<h3>Clothing brand increased revenue by 141% per campaign</h3>
<p>Clothing brand Johnny Cupcakes launched a segmented email marketing campaign for the product launch of its new baseball T-shirts.</p>
<p>By simply segmenting their email list into male and female subscribers they saw a <a href="http://www.marketingsherpa.com/article/case-study/social-behavioral-email-segmentation">141% increase in revenue per campaign</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1123" src="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/how-to-segment-your-email-list-demographic-data-exampe.jpg" alt="how to segment your email marketing list demographic data example" width="800" height="393" srcset="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/how-to-segment-your-email-list-demographic-data-exampe-610x300.jpg 610w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/how-to-segment-your-email-list-demographic-data-exampe-305x150.jpg 305w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/how-to-segment-your-email-list-demographic-data-exampe-400x197.jpg 400w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/how-to-segment-your-email-list-demographic-data-exampe-300x147.jpg 300w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/how-to-segment-your-email-list-demographic-data-exampe.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><i>Emails sent by Johnny Cupcakes segmented by gender.</i></em></p>
<p>This basic demographic segmentation resulted in:</p>
<ul>
<li>42% increase in clickthrough rates</li>
<li>123% increase in conversion rate</li>
<li>141% increase in revenue per campaign</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fashion store increases sales by 550%</h3>
<p>A fashion store identified a segment of customers who had made one or <a href="https://canopylabs.com/blog/increasing-e-mail-based-sales-by-5-5-times-a-case-study-in-segmentation" target="_blank">two significant purchases</a>, but don&#8217;t visit or buy on a regular basis.</p>
<p>This allowed the fashion store to send this segment of their customer base an email thanking them for their past purchase and inviting them to purchase again with a small tailored offer in an attempt to re-active them.</p>
<p><a href="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-segmentation-case-studies-ROI-fashion-co.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1132" src="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-segmentation-case-studies-ROI-fashion-co.jpg" alt="email segmentation case studies ROI at a Fashion Store" width="800" height="481" srcset="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-segmentation-case-studies-ROI-fashion-co-610x367.jpg 610w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-segmentation-case-studies-ROI-fashion-co-249x150.jpg 249w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-segmentation-case-studies-ROI-fashion-co-400x241.jpg 400w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-segmentation-case-studies-ROI-fashion-co-300x180.jpg 300w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-segmentation-case-studies-ROI-fashion-co.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Segmented vs Generic Email Campaigns</i></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This basic behavioural (purchase history) segmentation resulted in:</p>
<ul>
<li>41% increase in open rates</li>
<li>41% increase in clickthrough rates</li>
<li>550% increase in purchases per campaign</li>
</ul>
<h3>E-commerce site increased CTR by 410%</h3>
<p><a href="https://doggyloot.com/" target="_blank">Doggyloot</a> is a flash sale site that helps dog owners spoil their beloved canines. The company segments and personalizes emails based on &#8220;doggy data,&#8221; not people data.</p>
<p>The company segments their customers into <a href="http://www.marketingsherpa.com/article/case-study/email-personalization-ctr-ecommerce-site#" target="_blank">3 groups based on dog size</a>. Small, medium, and large. This segmentation is based on the logic that it doesn&#8217;t make sense to offer a 10-pound bone to a five-pound dog. This basic level of segmentation yields some impressive results.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1133 size-full" src="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-segmentation-case-studies-ROI-doggyloot.png" alt="email segmentation case studies ROI at doggyloot" width="1106" height="802" srcset="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-segmentation-case-studies-ROI-doggyloot-610x442.png 610w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-segmentation-case-studies-ROI-doggyloot-930x674.png 930w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-segmentation-case-studies-ROI-doggyloot-207x150.png 207w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-segmentation-case-studies-ROI-doggyloot-400x290.png 400w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-segmentation-case-studies-ROI-doggyloot-300x218.png 300w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-segmentation-case-studies-ROI-doggyloot.png 1106w" sizes="(max-width: 1106px) 100vw, 1106px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Email sent to customers that own large dogs</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This basic demographical (dog size) segmentation resulted in:</p>
<ul>
<li>10% increase in open rate</li>
<li>410% increase in click through rates</li>
<li>13% increase in revenue per campaign</li>
</ul>
<h3>E-commerce site increased revenue by 278%</h3>
<p>Online men&#8217;s retailer <a href="http://onwardreserve.com/" target="_blank">Onward Reserve</a> segmented customers based on purchase data that increased their <a href="http://web.windsorcircle.com/Portals/254322/images/windsor-circle-case-study-onward-reserve.pdf?submissionGuid=48f343b6-0956-41b9-9a8f-b1a400e9f5bf" target="_blank">conversions by 233%</a>.</p>
<p>By leveraging the purchasing data at their disposal Onward Reserve were able to segment each subscriber into one of four customer types: best customers (at least 3 purchases), non-purchasers, churning customers and other. These distinct groups were sent different messages tailored to their previous on-site behaviour.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1134" src="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-segmentation-case-studies-ROI-onward-reserve.png" alt="email segmentation case studies ROI at onward reserve" width="709" height="797" srcset="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-segmentation-case-studies-ROI-onward-reserve-610x686.png 610w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-segmentation-case-studies-ROI-onward-reserve-400x450.png 400w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-segmentation-case-studies-ROI-onward-reserve-300x337.png 300w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-segmentation-case-studies-ROI-onward-reserve.png 709w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 100vw, 709px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Email onward reserve sends to &#8216;best customers&#8217;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This basic behavioural (purchase frequency) segmentation resulted in:</p>
<ul>
<li>41% increase in open rates</li>
<li>183% increase in click through rates</li>
<li>278% increase in revenue</li>
</ul>
<h3> Multi-channel retail store increased open rates by 40%</h3>
<p>SwayChic is the e-commerce store for a California-based women’s fashion retailer, Sway. The brand features six brick-and-mortar stores and it&#8217;s through these stores Sway&#8217;s associates organically collect customer email addresses.</p>
<p>They created new campaigns which were segmented into different time slots as well as tailoring the emails based on their customers historic purchase behaviour. For example, one-time buyer, frequent buyers, and buyers who were no longer engaged.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.marketingsherpa.com/article/case-study/lift-average-open-rate-segmentation" target="_blank">In creating this campaign</a>, they used historical data to test different attributes, such as days with the highest open rates, past purchases, and time of actual conversions.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1135" src="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-segmentation-case-studies-ROI-Swaychic.jpg" alt="email-segmentation-case-studies-ROI-Swaychic" width="800" height="683" srcset="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-segmentation-case-studies-ROI-Swaychic-610x521.jpg 610w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-segmentation-case-studies-ROI-Swaychic-176x150.jpg 176w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-segmentation-case-studies-ROI-Swaychic-400x342.jpg 400w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-segmentation-case-studies-ROI-Swaychic-300x256.jpg 300w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-segmentation-case-studies-ROI-Swaychic.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a previous post we went through the importance of having a email<a href="http://birdleaf.io/why-email-marketing-segmentation-matters" target="_blank"> marketing segmentation strategy </a>in place. Despite the common argument that email is dying, it is still one of the top performing channels for acquiring and retaining customers.</p>
<p>Segmenting lists will help you more easily target your customers. It will allow you to send email content to your subscribers that is tailored to their wants and needs, which will drastically improve your open and click-through and conversion rates.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1121" src="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-list-segmentation-results.jpg" alt="how to segment your email list results" width="600" height="421" srcset="http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-list-segmentation-results-214x150.jpg 214w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-list-segmentation-results-400x281.jpg 400w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-list-segmentation-results-300x211.jpg 300w, http://birdleaf.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/email-list-segmentation-results.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>In this post we&#8217;ll go through how to segment your email list so you can start achieving higher conversion rates.</p>
<h3><b>What You&#8217;ll Need</b></h3>
<p>Segmenting your email list can seem like a daunting challenge but it honestly doesn&#8217;t take much to get it started. You&#8217;ll just need to commit some time to the planning process to make sure you can effectively implement your plans.</p>
<p>To start segmenting your email list you&#8217;ll need some basic customer information. This can be anything, such as their gender or location. These basic data points are enough to get you started, so don&#8217;t worry if you limited data on your customers. As your segmentation strategy evolves and you identify the crucial data points you need and start collecting this information.</p>
<p>You shouldn&#8217;t need any additional tools to get started if you&#8217;re already using an email marketing tool. Most email marketing tools, like <a href="http://mailchimp.com" target="_blank">Mailchimp</a> or <a href="http://www.aweber.com" target="_blank">AWeber</a>, make it really simple to organise your segments automatically.</p>
<h3><strong>Different Data Types For Segmentation</strong></h3>
<p>There are many for you to segment your customer list to provide more relevant content to your subscribers. In reality, any data that you can tie back to a subscriber could be a segment. Each business is going to want to segment their subscribers using different data points. For example, an e-commerce company may choose to Gender and Age to segment their subscribers. While on the other hand a B2B software company may choose to segment based on Industry and Job Role. Here are some samples of the types of segmentation you can implement: Demographic, Behavioural, and Purchase Cycle.</p>
<h5 id="blogsubhead"><strong>Demographical Data</strong></h5>
<p>Demographic data is any personal characteristics of a person, such as age,  gender, job etc. One of the main advantages of demographic segmentation is that the information you need is readily available for you, and you can group subscribers together without getting specific. That being said, demographical segmentation can be highly effective.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Emails sent by Johnny Cupcakes segmented by gender.</i></p>
<p>Clothing brand Johnny Cupcakes launched a segmented email marketing campaign for the product launch of its new baseball T-shirts. By simply segmenting their email list into male and female subscribers they saw a <a href="http://www.marketingsherpa.com/article/case-study/social-behavioral-email-segmentation">141% increase in revenue per campaign</a>. This massive increase in revenue resulted from a 42% increase in clickthrough rate and 123% more conversions.</p>
<p>Depending on your target market you can try using these demographic groups to segment your list:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gender</strong> &#8211; like the example above. This works really well for e-commerce fashion companies. If you are selling to both men and women then generic email marketing will be a total flop.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location </strong>&#8211; if you want to offer free shipping across the U.S, you can&#8217;t be marketing the coupon code to this customers living in Canada. Knowing where your customers live and marketing to their location is essential to building a positive email reputation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Job Role </strong>&#8211; this is definitely more applicable for B2B businesses. Segmenting subscribers based on job role can be really effective. For instance, the sales pitch you would send a Sales Rep would be different then that you would send the VP of Sales.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Industry  </strong>&#8211;  different industries should be approached and marketed differently. For example, if you have three different customerKnowing your customer&#8217;s industry may allow you to add a level of personalization or authority to your content. This is more impactful for B2B businesses.</li>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Email sent to best customers identified by purchasing data.</em></p>
<p>Online mens reatiler <a href="http://onwardreserve.com" target="_blank">Onward Reserve</a> segmented customers based on purchase data that increased their conversions by 233% and revenue by 278%. By leveraging the purchasing data at their disposal Onward Reserve were able to segment each subscriber into one of four customer types: best customers (at least 3 purchases), non-purchasers, churning customers and other. These distinct groups were sent different messages tailored to their previous on-site behaviour.</p>
<p>Try using these behaviuoral segments to target people based on their interactions with your product or service:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What they purchase</strong> &#8211; Amazon does an amazing job of this with their &#8220;You bought this, so you might like this” upsell. By knowing someones past purchases you can use that information to send them emails catered to that which interests them. This will lead to more purchases and a longer lifetime value.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purchase frequency </strong>&#8211; some people may purchase every week whereas some subscribers may be repeat customers but only purchase once a year. By looking at each customer’s buying behaviour JAM Paper&#8217;s team calculated the average time between orders for each customer and began sending the “lapsed purchase” email once each person passed their individual threshold. This tactic yielded a <a href="http://sherpablog.marketingsherpa.com/email-marketing/list-segmentation-tips/" target="_blank">45% conversion rate</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>What they do in your product</strong> &#8211; this allows you to send tailored messages to your subscribers based on their interaction with your website or application. Triggered messages are a great way to engage with your customers without effort. For example, a lot of e-commerce companies will target subscribers who added a product to the shopping cart but didn&#8217;t complete the purchase. If they haven&#8217;t completed the purchase within 24 hours, an email is triggered targeted toward that specific target group.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free vs paid users</strong> &#8211; for both segments of users you have very different objectives. Your goal with non-paying users is to convert as many as possible. Whereas your goal with paid users is to retain as many as possible.With that in mind you&#8217;ll probably send a lot of upgrade pitches to your free users, and for your paid users you will send them tailored messages to keep them engaged in the product.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="blogsubhead"><strong>Position In Sales Cycle</strong></h5>
<p>Each one of your subscribers is inevitably going to be at a different point in your sales cycle.

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Segmenting customer based on position in sales cycle.</em></p>
<p>News agency PR Newswire <a href="http://www.marketingsherpa.com/article/case-study/shortened-sales-cycle" target="_blank">shortened its sales cycle by 30% </a>by aligning their email content to each stage of the buyers journey. As you watch a lead move through the sales funnel you will be able to pinpoint the right time for your sales team to get in touch directly. This will allow you to minimize the likelyhood of a Sales Rep wasting time on unqualified leads.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Top of the funnel </strong>&#8211; for prospects at the top of the sales funnel content should be educational and product-neutral. Think about white papers and content that&#8217;s focused on industry relevant topics, not your product. Prospects at this stage might not even be aware that they have a fixable problem, so identifying this problem should be your focus for this stage.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Middle of the funnel </strong>&#8211; as prospects move into the middle of the funnel your content should get a bit more specific. The aim of the game at this stage is to get your prospects thinking about the advantages of having your product. So you can send out case studies about how a similar business has the same problem and this is how they fixed it using our product.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bottom of the funnel </strong>&#8211; once a prospect reaches the bottom of the funnel you need to start actively selling them your product. At this stage they&#8217;re going to be well educated on the problem area and are potentially looking for a solution.  Getting a sales rep to contact the prospect and go through a buyers guide and implementation strategy is really important.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Takeaways</strong></h3>
<p>Each one of your subscribers, prospect, customers are different in some way. For this reason it&#8217;s really important to segment your email marketing list in an attempt to tailor your messages so they are relevant to the recipient.</p>
<p>How you segment your list will depend on your target audience and what level of data you have on each subscriber. To start maximising the impact of your email marketing you can segment your list using demographic, behavioural, or sales cycle data.</p>
